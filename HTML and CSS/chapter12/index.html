    <h3>Breed History</h3>
    <p>The briard, which is believed to have originaed in France, has been breed for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army 
        as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sence of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction.
        Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jeffesrson and Lafayette all owned briards.
