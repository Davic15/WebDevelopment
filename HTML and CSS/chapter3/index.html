    <h2>Definition</h2>

        <dt>Eggs</dt>
        <dd>The egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. 
            An egg results from fertilization of an egg cell. 
            Most arthropods, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not.</dd>
        <dt>Butter</dt>
        <dd>Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of milk or cream. It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature, 
            consisting of approximately 80% butterfat. It is used at room temperature as a spread, melted as a condiment, and used as an ingredient in baking, 
            sauce making, pan frying, and other cooking procedures.</dd>
